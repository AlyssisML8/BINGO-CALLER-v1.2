# BINGO-CALLER-v1.2

BINGO CALLER served as my initial project when I began to code. Some years later, I see the code (which was understandably bad), and I decided to redo it with the same features but better code practices and stuff. I don't know what I'm going to do with this, honestly.

For context, this is a TTS program that is supposed to say numbers from 1 to 60 out loud, like a Bingo Caller, no surprises.
