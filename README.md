# BINGO-CALLER-v1.2

BINGO CALLER was my first project back then when I started to code. Now, some years later, I saw the code (which was understandably bad, by the way) and I decided to redo it with the same features but better code practices and stuff. I don't know what I'm going to do with this, honestly.

For context, this is a TTS program that is supposed to say numbers from 1 to 60 out loud, like a Bingo Caller, no surprises.
